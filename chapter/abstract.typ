The diploma thesis 3BB deals with the connection and protection of IT and OT networks. The OT network is modeled as a railway network using components like a programmable logic controller (PLC) and remote terminal units (RTUs). The components control the actuators (such as points and trains) to ensure railway traffic. A customised switch and block control system was developed and implemented as part of the thesis. As a result, the topology serves as a training environment for a future OT security course.

In the IT network, an Active Directory was configured to simulate a corporate environment for managing the railway control system. The infrastructure consists of two locations, several departments and their users. Based on this infrastructure, employees are granted controlled access to the railway control system.

The two networks are secured by Fortinet firewalls. This restricts Internet access, minimizing attack vectors and reducing cybersecurity risks. In addition, the firewalls at the sites are interconnected via encrypted VPN connections, ensuring secure communication between the networks.

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM for short) and a Security Operations Centre (SOC for short) were implemented to guarantee network security. The SIEM is used to monitor the network in order to recognise anomalies. The security gaps that are then recognised are communicated to the SOC via events.

To evaluate the infrastructure's resilience, various cyberattacks are simulated. These include the detection of information in the network, manipulation of the railway control system and the failure of critical components. The impact of these attacks are thoroughly logged and analyzed.

The 3BB diploma thesis demonstrates the cybersecurity challenges facing critical infrastructure and highlights the essential defense strategies to mitigate them.
